        <p>
          This webpage is hosted on some old computer made in the early 00s in my basement.
          As it approaches the end of its life, I humbly request that you do not DDoS this address (poor computer can
          barely turn on at this point &#9785;). Anyway, this webpage is just a little
          project I've been working on in an attempt to learn more about web development
          and server administration.
